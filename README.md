# My Portfolio Projects (Excel, SQL, PowerBI and Python)

## Here you can find analyses which I did in SQL, Excel and Python. Some of them I did on my own, and some of them were part of guided projects.

### 3 databases were analyzed in SQLite, with their results being reported in PowerBI
### 2 datasets were analyzed and graphically reported completely in Excel
### 2 datasets were uploaded and analyzed in Python
