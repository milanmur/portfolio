# My Portfolio Projects
Here you can find few analyses which I did in SQL and Excel. Some of them I did on my own, and some of them were part of guided projects.
Three datasets were analyzed in SQL, and one of them was interpreted in Microsoft PowerBI. Two datasets were analyzed and reported in Excel.
